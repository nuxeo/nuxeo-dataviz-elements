# About nuxeo-dataviz-elements

**Nuxeo Data Visualization Elements** are a set of elements for building data visualization dashboards with Nuxeo.

## Dependencies

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can
install that via:

    npm install -g bower

Then, go ahead and download the element's dependencies:

    bower install

## Quickstart

We recommend that you use [Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) which you can install via:

    npm install -g polyserve

And you can run it via:

    polyserve -p 3000

Once running, you can checkout the docs and demo at `http://localhost:3000/components/nuxeo-dataviz-elements/`.

## Testing

Simply navigate to the `/test` directory of your element to run its tests. If
you are using Polyserve: `http://localhost:8080/components/nuxeo-dataviz-elements/test/`

### web-component-tester

The tests are compatible with [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester).
Install it via:

    npm install -g web-component-tester

Then, you can run your tests on _all_ of your local browsers via:

    wct

#### WCT Tips

`wct -l chrome` will only run tests in chrome.

`wct -p` will keep the browsers alive after test runs (refresh to re-run).

`wct test/some-file.html` will test only the files you specify.
